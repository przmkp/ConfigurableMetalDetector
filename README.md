Modification for Terraria 1.4 using tModLoader

From mod description:
Configurable Metal Detector is a simple mod that allows you to configure values used by Metal Detector to determine which item in your vicinity is the most valuable. It basically lets you change priority of the items displayed by Metal Detector. Higher value means higher priority.

This mod has been created to change the behaviour of this item that prioritized Life Crystal over Hardmode ores, then expanded to cover all (vanilla) items detectable by this accessory.

Note: for the changes in the config to take effect you need to reload your mods (Main menu -> Mods -> Reload mods)
