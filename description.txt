Configurable Metal Detector is a simple mod that allows you to configure values used by Metal Detector to determine which item in your vicinity is the most valuable. It basically lets you change priority of the items displayed by Metal Detector. Higher value means higher priority.

This mod has been created to change the behaviour of this item that prioritized Life Crystal over Hardmode ores, then expanded to cover all (vanilla) items detectable by this accessory.

The changes in the config should start working immediately.

New: Added an option to detect gems.
